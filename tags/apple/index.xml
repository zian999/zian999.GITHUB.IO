      <description>I purchased the Smart Keyboard for my iPad Pro 10.5 on the first day it was available. It worked well for about 2 years and I donâ€™t remember from when it suddenly stopped working. Nothing happens if I connect it to my iPad. After some googling I found that this seems to be a common problem encountered by other Smart Keyboard owners. But no reliable solutions to this problem can be found.</description>
