      <title>Get p-values for the fixed effect terms in (g)lmer models</title>

      <description>For some reason (see GLMM faq and here for more detail), the lmer function in the lme4 package doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide p-values for fixed effect terms.
If you use lme4::glmer, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that there are p-values listed in the summary of the model. However, I found two problems of them. First, those p-values are actually indicating the significance of the coefficients (i.e., whether the betas you got are different from 0 or not), not testing the effects.</description>

      <description>The Lightroom 6 was killed by Adobe in 2017 and will never get updates any more. For people (like me) who don&amp;rsquo;t want to subscribe to Adobe&amp;rsquo;s plans and are sticking with LR6, I found a way to add new lens profiles to LR6.</description>

      <description>Two week ago, we went to the Point Pelee National Park to watch the migrating birds (mainly warblers). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful experience. We saw a lot of birds that we have never seen before in local area.</description>
